      "Plot: on april 12, 1961, soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin blasted off in a vostok rocket, becoming the first human in space and orbiting earth for 108 minutes. he was one of the first group of cosmonauts who were selected from over three thousand fighter pilots throughout the soviet union. the legendary top twenty who were selected were the ace of aces and none of the pilots knew which amongst them would make history on the first manned flight. once chosen gagarin is fasttracked to train for the unknown and the trip of a lifetime. whilst strapped into his rocket, gagarin reflects on his life, which is intercut with the determination of the russian space team and their untiring efforts to conquer space.\n",

      "Plot: early in the year of 1979, japans most famed rocketship, the jx1 hawk, with its crew of 30 men, was launched from the interstellar exploration agencys rocket launch site at mt fuji into space on a 9month journey to investigate the planet saturn. after a 9 months journey to saturn, the crew are given a new directive for the mission from earth. it was discovered that a small, runaway planet, which some scientists believed to be the solid megadense core of a collapsed star that had somehow run amok. it is subsequently given the name gorath by the international scientific community, had entered earths solar system. upon encountering gorath and attempting to investigate its rapid movement in the solar system, they discover that gorath is smaller than earth but with 6000 times earths gravity. the jx1 is caught in its gravity well and its entire crew of the spacecraft lose their lives as the enormous gravity well of the approaching celestial body destroyed the ship. back on earth during the christmas season, the transmitted data made its way back to earth. a month later in 1980, astronomers and astrophysicists throughout the international community announce that the enormous celestial body would collide with the earth in two years time. later at the united nations, a gathering of earths top scientists resolved to this allimportant goal by pooling together large amounts of technical advancements they made in the past two decades. after much debriefing, the scientific community unveiled their plan to save the earth. they dub the plan the south pole operation. the south pole operation base is to be designed to house a large international team of engineers and scientists. the plan involves the construction of huge rocket thruster engines, 500 meters below the surface and in an area 600 kilometers in diameter, producing an atomic force equal to that of 6,600,000,000 megatons. when completed and activated, these megathrusters would serve to literally move the earth more than 400,000 kilometers out of its orbit in 100 days until it was safely out of range of both the approaching star gorath and its devastating gravity well, and then move the earth back into its proper orbit once the danger had completely passed. the u.n. then sends the remaining prototype sublight spacecraft jx2 eagle into space to obtain further data on gorath. construction on the massive south pole base is put into action as ships and helicopters from many nations bring in building material necessary to the plan. in addition, powerful mobile heatgenerating devices known as atomic burrowers were quickly cobbled together to assist in the project of creating the caverns in the icy terrain of the antarctic that would be needed to house the booster rockets. meanwhile, in deep space, the jx2 eagle succeeds in its mission. the data they acquired, including the disturbing fact that gorath was continuously adding to its mass by absorbing more space debris in the path of its gravity well. this information was sent to the u.n. personnel on the three space stations sss1, terra and delta. back on earth, the first preliminary test of the rocket thrusters is about to commence. around the world, anxious citizens watch live television broadcasts of the event. the thrusters are activated and the results are witness from the orbiting space stations the earth is gently along. the south pole operation is hailed as a success and the earth was moving out of the way of goraths path. meanwhile, in space, with this news, the jx2 eagle is ordered to return to its base on earth, along with the threespace stations all of which were moved from orbit to avoid having the multibilliondollar constructs being struck by gorath when it approached the earth. back on earth, an unexpected threat was literally unearthed when the completed rocket boosters were tested. the backlash of incredible heat this created caused a gigantic, 30meterlong walrus to emerge from its home deep below the frozen tundra this creature was later named maguma in japanese press info about this incident maguma was evidently a hidden remnant of prehistoric creatures that survived into modern times. angered by the dramatic intrusion into his home, maguma began attacking the u.n. base. acting to save the installation, a small vtol craft that was used as a means of fast cargo transport, but also equipped with a powerful laser, was sent to stop the kaijus assault. the pilot was determined to halt the creature without killing him, and initially used the laser cannon to cause an avalanche that buried the beast. maguma easily escaped, however, and continued his attack. this left the south pole crew no choice but to turn the crafts deadly laser beam on the creature himself, and the enormous animal was killed. back in deep space, gorath was continuing its destructive path, now absorbing the rings of saturn. the jx2 and the three space stations finally arrive back on earth. sometime later, gorath is close enough to the earth to be seen by the naked eye and the atmosphere is reacting as the clouds are drawn toward the star. tides begin to rise and a state of emergency is declared. the moon, earths lone satellite is pulled in by goraths gravity well and is obliterated. goraths full effect upon the earth is felt as the great city of tokyo is flooded by a tsunami. at the interstellar exploration agency launch site at mt fuji, the jx2 and the space station terra are destroyed by an earthquake. the situation also became critical at the south pole operation base, as flooding waters enter the thruster area, extinguishing several fires. after the critical moment passed, the full global cooperation of every nation on the planet succeeded marvelously and earth was moved out of goraths path, and then successfully actuated back into its normal orbit, thus saving the planet from destruction.\n",
